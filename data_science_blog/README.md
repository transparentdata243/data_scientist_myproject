# Data Science Portfolio Projects

### Project 1 - Data Science Blog

**Description:** 

I analyzed the breach data set to understand the trends in data breaches over
the time. Specially I answer the following questions:

Q1: Does the incidents increase over time?

Q2: Does the amount of leaked accouts increase as the number of incident increase?

Q3: What are the top incidents?

Q4: Are their any companies that got hacked twice?

Q5: What is the ranking of the asset classes in these incidents?

Q6: Does any months has more incidents or more leaks than the others across the years?
